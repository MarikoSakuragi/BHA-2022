# Concepts
### My interests
・Actor-Network Theory(ANT) &  materiality in science<br/>
・How bio lab has became today’s form?<br/>
・Interests in old lab equipments, how they have been blackboxed.<br/>
<br/>
・**DIYbio… Weird fusion of old and new**<br/>
<br/>
・My inspiration is from Urs Gardenz’s lecture (Gaudi Lab).I am so impressed by his amazing invention of  DIY devices.<br/>
・Re-interpret and reconstruct lab equipments through historical research of lab equipments.<br/>
・According him, such historical research helps for DIY as reference and inspirations, because **old equipments are simpler and more open than modern devices**.<br/>

### Project：Research/Reproduce/Reconstruct
・Research about the historical improvement of Centrifuge<br/>
・For what it was used for? How was the design?<br/>
Actually, I’d like to research about the other lab equipments’ history (ex. incubator). However, because my making skill is not high, I chose centrifuge, thinking about final work.<br/>
・Reproduce old style centrifuge by 3D printer, using it for experiments.<br/>
　（Hopefully, I would like to add some newness on my work.）<br/>
・+ Record how my imagination and point of view change through the DIY process.<br/>
