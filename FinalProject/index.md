# Final Project

リサーチャーなので、調査をベースとしたものにしたい<br/>
<br/>
## Ideas and keywords
3/18
**Mobility**<br/>
I'm interested in the challenges in DIYbio to make laboratory mobile.<br/>
Go outside from laboratory<br/>
Now, the inside/outside of laboratory is spacially separated.<br/>
<br/>
Inspirations<br/>
・Suitsucase laboratory by Urs (GaudiLab)<br/>
・BentoLab by Philip<br/>
・屋台ラボ<br/>
<br/>
👉Can scientists be free from their laboratory?<br/>
👉Can scientists go travel over the world with mobile scientific tool-kit?<br/>

**History**<br/>
I want to put historical elements of science into my final project.<br/>
I'm interested in not only the brand-new science but also the historical side of science, especially the improvement of scientific tools. I would like to represent classic scientific tool or reinvent them.<br/>
<br/>
・地元、富山の薬売り　箱状のリュック、持ち運べる箪笥のようなもの<br/>
→売り歩く。何かを？　バイオ系の行商人みたいな人がいたら面白いんじゃないか<br/>
細胞とかを持ち運べないか<br/>
<br/>

・History of Incubator
[Wiki page]（https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubator_(culture)） written about incubator is interesting.<br>
<br>
I am surprised that incubator has long history. At the same time, I'm interested in the multiplicity in the use of it.<br>
<br>
I thought that incubator is the machine that helps cell culture.But not only in science, it has also been used in medical purpose. <br>
<br>
To begin with, incubator is not intended for scientific purpose. The earliest incubators were used for warming chicken eggs in ancient Egypt and China. <br>
In the 17th century, a entomologist Rene-Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur invented more sophisticated incubator. Reaumur made the incubater with a wood stove. <br>

<br>
In 19th, incubator began to be used for culturing cell. Moreover, doctors found that it could be apllied to keep premature infants alive. <br>
Later, an American physician Julius H. Hess created the first electric infant incubator.<br>
<br>
I was fascinated the history of incubator. I think there is a keyword = "care": caring baby and caring cells. <br/>
<br/>
👉Infant-incubator-formed incubator for cell culture?

**Centrifuge**<br/>
Classic design of centrifuge (1941, made by Shimazu Seisaku-sho)<br/>
