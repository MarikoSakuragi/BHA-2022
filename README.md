# About me
## Mariko Sakuragi
I am a doctoral student at Osaka University, focusing on medical anthropology and STS. My doctoral project is about current citizen science movement in Japan. Particularly, I examine the DIY biology movement, investigating the DIY practices regarding biotechnology and new understandings of technology by sharing and circulation of tools. My interests also include the new human-nonhuman relationships forming by way of these movements.

#### What is Life? How would you define it, can you actually define it?
Defining "what is life" is a awkward question. So, I would like to point the part of significant elements that Life includes, instead of putting exact answer. The word "Life" reminds me an aggregation that is continuously moving. In my thought, Life is related to continuousness, because it renews our bodies by metabolisms, and hand down something to the next generation by reproduction. In addition, Life is not single but many: it is both the process and results of various species' work and interactions. We can see Life in many scales -- microbiomes, groups of plants, animals, and insects, and ecosystems -- but what is most important is no living things cannot live without other living things. We co-exist by making use of each other, for example, eating, hunting, and  parasitizing.

#### What is BioHacking? What does it mean for you?
A social scientist Sarah Davies who studies hackerspace says in her book that hacking(including DIY) is a practice to open "blackbox." In other words, hacking is a sort of critical attitude against an exist world that is closed and hidden from us by showing  material alternatives."Tweaking and making things work better you means that you have to think in new ways about what objects or technologies can do, hacking them away from their original purpose or design into something new, different and perhaps surprising” (Davies 2017: 67). Followed Davies's argument,  people do hacking for knowing more about technologies and for getting more closer to the invisible world by making something by making something by their own.

Speaking of BioHacking,

#### Why are you interested in Bio?
1. I am interested in Bio because bio is fundamental of nature, bodies, and our lives. At the same time, bio is full of mystery like the universe which is endless, and nobody has never saw the end. That is the reason Bio has a gravity that attracts people for centuries.（...）

2. As symbolized by the DIYbio, various people has try to joining to know and do biology in this decade. I am curious about why Bio fascinates people, and how forms of Bio might transform in near future.

3. The story may goes away, I am also interested in the cultural and social power of biology. What is regarded as "right" (facts, tools, therapies etc. ) has changed/would change as time passed, and that always has influenced on how people live. Biomedicine not only improve treatments, it give birth the sociality like patient groups. It can go wrong by making categorization of people that could cause restriction or discrimination. So, I would like to know the boundary-making by Bio and the interactions of Bio and people.
