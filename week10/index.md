<br/>
#### 2. PCR on Bento Lab
<br/>
#### 3. PCR with Biotechnology 101 Kit
For all experiments using PCR in the Biotechnology 101 Kit, we will be provided with a specific set of primers. (1)<br/>
<br/>
In the 101 kit, there are PCR tubes with a freeze-dried PCR master mix bead (2). This bead contains:<br/>
- Taq Polymerase, the enzyme which performs the reaction.<br/>
- dNTPs (DNA nucleotide bases). These are the DNA bases (A, C, G and T) that are the building blocks of DNA. They are used by the polymerase to construct the new DNA copies.<br/>
- Buffer to ensure the right conditions for the reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we will prepare, as part of each experiment, specific template DNA (3). These need to be mixed in precise proportions, for which we will need the micropipette (4).<br/>

### Guide
#### 1. What is Gel Electrophoresis?
Gel Electrophoresis is a common analysis method of DNA and itâ€™s the key to visualising your results.<br/>

#### 2. The Gel Box
The orange lid (1) seals the gel box when the voltage is applied and also functions as a filter for the transilluminator, to render the fluorescing DNA visible.The base (2) is used to cast and run the gel. It has the red positive electrode, and the black negative one. Each of the electrodes is made of a thin platinum wire.<br/>
<br/>
Two rubber dams are used to create buffer zones around the electrodes during gel casting (3). There are also combs to create 9 and 12 well gels (4).<br/>
