### Guide
#### 1. What is PCR
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method used in molecular biology to make millions of physical copies of a specific DNA sequence, for example, a gene.<br/>
<br/>
A **primer** is **a short single strand of DNA that serves as a starting point for DNA synthesis of a new DNA strand**. It is required for DNA replication because the enzymes that catalyze this process, DNA polymerases, can only add new nucleotides to an existing fragment of DNA.<br/>
<br/>
1. First Step: Denaturing<br/>
First, the DNA template is heated, which causes the double-stranded DNA to separate into two single strands.<br/>
<br/>
2. Second Step: Annealing<br/>
40-60℃: annealing temprature<br/>
At this point, the primers will attach, or anneal, to their binding positions on the single strands of the template DNA.<br/>
<br/>
3. Third Step: Extending<br/>
In the next step, the reaction moves to an optimal temperature for the polymerase enzyme (1), from which PCR takes its name, to start working. The polymerase enzyme builds DNA strands, and it will extend the DNA from the primer along the DNA template, creating a new DNA strand, which combines with the single-stranded template to form a double strand. The polymerase enzyme uses dNTPs (2), free DNA nucleotide bases as the building blocks for the new strand.<br/>

#### 3. PCR with Biotechnology 101 Kit
For all experiments using PCR in the Biotechnology 101 Kit, you will be provided with a specific set of primers. (1)<br/>
<br/>
In the 101 kit, there are PCR tubes with a freeze-dried PCR master mix bead (2). This bead contains:<br/>
- Taq Polymerase, the enzyme which performs the reaction.<br/>
- dNTPs (DNA nucleotide bases). These are the DNA bases (A, C, G and T) that are the building blocks of DNA. They are used by the polymerase to construct the new DNA copies.<br/>
- Buffer to ensure the right conditions for the reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you will prepare, as part of each experiment, specific template DNA (3). These need to be mixed in precise proportions, for which you will need the micropipette (4).<br/>

### Guide
#### 1. What is Gel Electrophoresis?
Gel Electrophoresis is a common analysis method of DNA and it’s the key to visualising your results.<br/>

#### 2. The Gel Box
The orange lid (1) seals the gel box when the voltage is applied and also functions as a filter for the transilluminator, to render the fluorescing DNA visible.The base (2) is used to cast and run the gel. It has the red positive electrode, and the black negative one. Each of the electrodes is made of a thin platinum wire.<br/>
<br/>
Two rubber dams are used to create buffer zones around the electrodes during gel casting (3). There are also combs to create 9 and 12 well gels (4).<br/>
