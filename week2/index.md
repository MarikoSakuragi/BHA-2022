### 1. Making Foldscope
#### <font color="Olive">- About Foldscope
Foldscope is a small and low-cost microscope made by paper. It was designed by Manu Prakash, a Professor of Oxford University. He developed Foldscope by hoping to make microscope more accessible for children in developing countries such as India. <br/>
On March 8th, we assmbled Foldscope from the kit, and do observation by it.<br/>

・Instruction manual<br/>
・Parts of Assembly<br/>
  **Main Parts**<br/>
　　　　Lens stage, Sample stage, Panning guide, Focus ramp<br/>
　**Sub Parts**<br/>
　　　　Slides, Coupler, Lens, Ring sticker, Covership stickers<br/>

#### <font color="Olive">- How to make Foldscope
1. Tear off each parts along perforation.<br/>
2. Place and insert coupler into center holes.<br/>
3. Flip Lens Stage, put coupler into down holes.<br/>
4. Turn back lens stage. Insert Focus ramp under the lens which is put at (2).<br/>
5. Assemple Sample stage and Panning guide<br/>
　（Causion: If you don't assemble them right, sample stage will not move.)<br/>
6. Assemple (5) and Lens Stage.<br/>
7. Finish! Let's check if you make correctly by sliding Panning guide and Focus ramp. If these are moved smoothly, it's done! Let's look through the microscope.<br/>
