### 1. Making Foldscope
#### <font color="Olive">- About Foldscope
Foldscope is a small and low-cost microscope made by paper. It was designed by Manu Prakash, a Professor of Oxford University. He developed Foldscope by hoping to make microscope more accessible for children in developing countries such as India. <br/>
On March 8th, we assmbled Foldscope from the kit, and do observation by it.<br/>

・Instruction manual<br/>
・Parts of Assembly<br/>
  **Main Parts**<br/>
　　　　Lens stage, Sample stage, Panning guide, Focus ramp<br/>
　**Sub Parts**<br/>
　　　　Slides, Coupler, Lens, Ring sticker, Covership stickers<br/>

#### <font color="Olive">- How to make Foldscope
1. Tear off each parts along perforation.<br/>
2. Place and insert coupler into center holes.<br/>
3. Flip Lens Stage, put coupler into down holes.<br/>
4. Turn back lens stage. Insert Focus ramp under the lens which is put at (2).<br/>
5. Assemple Sample stage and Panning guide<br/>
　（Causion: If you don't assemble them right, sample stage will not move.)<br/>
6. Assemple (5) and Lens Stage.<br/>
7. Finish! Let's check if you make correctly by sliding Panning guide and Focus ramp. If these are moved smoothly, it's done! Let's look through the microscope.<br/>

**・Soldering**<br/>
The parts of  Pocket PCR is quite simple: a circuit board, small electric fan, and a button.（＋フタ、オプションでケース） A tube hole and a monitor are put on the reverse side of the circuit board. You have to solder the button and fan in the ordered place of the circuit board, following instructions. To make it easy, it is better heat  the position which will be soldered, with soldering iron. Be careful not to leave any space in order to bond the parts steadily.(脚をつける。３Dプリンタで作れるケースにある)<br/>
<br/>
**・Start PCR**<br/>
When connected to power source with type-C cable, Pocket PCR works and the screen on. You can use computer or mobile buttery as power source. In the setup page, you can set heating/cooling tempratures, time, and cycles of PCR by push or turn the button. The setup manipulation is not difficult. After press the "Run PCR," PCR will start. Don't touch the <br/>
