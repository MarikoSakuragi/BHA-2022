## Biosafety
### Be careful to "biological agents"<br>
„ÉªThe "biological agents" do not include only what causes harm. Rather, they are any micro-organism, including genetically modified, cell culture or endoparasite.<br>
### Risks inside & outside the Lab
„ÉªWe must avoid risks to yourself, populations, environments...and these are connected each other.<br>
<br>
### Bio-occupational Health strategy
„ÉªChange material: safe strain [biological containment]<br>
„ÉªTechnical measuresÔºàcontainmentÔºâ<br>
„ÉªOrganizationÔºàTraining, SOPs, access controlÔºâ<br>
„ÉªHygieneÔºàHands washÔºâ<br>
„ÉªPPEÔºàCoat/gown, gloves, glasses, respirator, ‚Ä¶Ôºâ<br>
„ÉªVaccinationÔºànecessary & safficientÔºâ<br>
„ÉªPost exposition prophylaxisÔºàPEP: very much dependent on organismÔºâ<br>
<br>
### Biosafety Level
The are four categories of biosafety level.<br>

<br>
## Biology Basic
### The diversity of life<br/>
Aristotle, Carl Linnaeus, Ernst Haeckel‚Ä¶ They made distinction of life in different way. It shows how difficult it is to categorize organisms.<br/>

### Survival of the Fittest

<br/>
### Limits to Growth or Petridish Planet
„ÉªCompetition for Resources: Food (nutrients), Energy, Space, Water.<br/>
„ÉªEvading Competition: Temperature, Chemicals, Radiation, Gravity<br/>
<br/>
### SCOBY
‚ÄúSymbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast‚Äù<br/>
Combination/collaboration of organisms.<br/>
<br/>
Yeast to produce alcohol from sugar<br/>
Bacteria to produce acid from alcohol<br/>
<br/>
Bacteria produce cellulose<br/>
<br/>
### Symbiosis
‚ÄúSym‚Äù = ‚ÄúTogether‚Äù, ‚ÄúBio‚Äù = ‚ÄúLiving‚Äù<br/>
Cell is one of the example of symbiosis.<br/>
<br/>
### Central Paradigm: DNA-RNA-Protein-Trait
Any organisms have DNAÔºàDNA=information sourcesÔºâ<br/>
DNA(Gene) -> RNA(Message) -> Protein<br/>
<br/>

## Making Mediums
### Standard Medium
**3/22(Tue) & 3/24(Thu)**<br/>
**Contents**<br/>
„ÉªWater 500ml<br/>
„ÉªSugar 15g<br/>
„ÉªAgar 6g<br/>
„ÉªVitamin (optional)<br/>
<br/>
**How to make**<br/>
(1)Mix every contents<br/>
„ÄÄMake a mixture of agar and nutrients to glow organisms.<br/>
<br/>
(1-1)Put a stirrer bar into a little bigger flask.<br/>
<br/>
(1-2)Pour 500ml water into the flask.<br/>
<br/>
(1-3)Mesure exactly sugar and agar powder. When measuring, you should put a weighing paper on a scale.Instead of weighing paper, it is also OK to measure by using cups of beakers on the scale.<br/>
![Medium_1](/photo/92924.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(1-4)Mix (1-3) into the water.(It is easier to put the powders if you fold the weighing paper diagnally.)<br/>
![Medium_2](/photo/92920.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(1-5)Turn on the magnetic stirrer to mix up the water and the others.<br/>
<br/>
(2)Sterilization<br/>
**Autocrave** is used for sterilization. Autocrave is like a steamcooker that sterilizes by high temprature steam.<br/>
![Medium_3](/photo/92913.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
**How to use**<br/>
 (2-1)Before use, it is necessary to check there is water enough inside an autocrave. To check, kick lightly the side of the autocrave and watch whether the water waves at the bottom.<br/>
 <br/>
 (2-3)Cover the mouth of the bottle with aluminium foil. (I forget why...)<br/>
 <br/>
 (2-2)Seal autocrave tape on somewhere of the bottle. It helps to tell whether it has already went through autocrave. After autocraving, stripes appear on the tape.<br/>
„ÄÄPoint: Loose a lid a little to avoid explosion.<br/>
<br/>
![Medium_4](/photo/92916.jpg)<br/>
![Medium_5](/photo/92889.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
„ÄÄ(2-4)Turn on the switch. Although autocraving takes around 15 minutes, we need to wait longer till the pressure in the autocrave fully fall. <br/>
<br/>
(3)Pour Liquid Solution into Petridish<br/>
<br/>
(3-1)Place the bottle out of the autoclave in a clean bench. Be careful not to burn!<br/>
<br/>
(3-2) Pour the medium into petri dishes from the bottle, about (1„Äú3mm).<br/>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ Point: Minimize the time to open the lid of a petri dish as possible.<br/>
![Medium_6](/photo/92891.jpg)<br/>
(Trivia: YCAM bio-research team uses a kettle instead of glass bottles üëÄ‚Äº According to them, kettle is so convenient to pour mediums.)<br/>
<br/>
(3-4)Point: Sterilize EVERYTHING before put them into clean bench by spraying or wiping with alcohol, since bacterias could be on it. <br/>
![Medium_7](/photo/92912.jpg)<br/>
![Medium_8](/photo/92885.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
**Sampling**<br/>
Rub wherever you like with a cotton swab or a bamboo skewer, then spread it on the surface of medium. The spreading should be done gently.
<br/>
We took samples from many place: nose, arm skins, plants, surface of masks, the outside air, etc. Next week We will observe whether bacteria has grow on these mediums. <br/>

## Homemade Medium
**3/27(Sun)**<br/>
I made a DIY medium at my kitchen.<br/>
### Contents
![DIY medium Contents](/photo/92198.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
„ÄÄ„ÉªWater 250ml<br/>
„ÄÄ„ÉªAgar 4g<br/>
„ÄÄ„ÉªSugar 6g<br/>
„ÄÄ„ÉªChicken Soup 2g<br/>
<br/>
I bought these items from supermarket and „Éâ„É≥„Ç≠„Éª„Éõ„Éº„ÉÜ (a discount chain store) near my house. Plus I bought a small alcohol spray in a 100-yen shop for sterilization.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make more special mediums, you should add other stuffs (yeast extractÔºàÈÖµÊØç„Ç®„Ç≠„ÇπÔºâ, for example).<br/>
![Alcohol Spray](/photo/92201.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
### Protocol
(1) Clean up kitchen at first(unless you keep it clean always). I tried to sterilize the kitchen counter by spraying alcohol. I also sprayed alcohol to a measuring cup, a pot, and a spoon.<br/>
![Kitchen counter](/photo/92202.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(2) Measure what is need. As I didn't have a scale, I used sugar and agar which packed in small portions, because it make it easily to measure how many grams.<br/>
<br/>
(3) Mix water, agar, sugar, and chicken soup in a pot.<br/>
![Mixing](/photo/92203.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(4) After the water comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and cook for 2 minutes with dissolving with spoon.<br/>
![Mixing2](/photo/92207.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(5) Pour it into plates.<br/>
![Pouring](/photo/92211.jpg)<br/>
![Pouring2](/photo/92212.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(6) Seal the plate's lid. Parafilm is generally used for it, but in this time I used a clingfilmÔºà„Çµ„É©„É≥„É©„ÉÉ„ÉóÔºâ.<br/>
![Closing](/photo/92213.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(7) Cool them down until the agar get hard. It will take about half a day till agar become hard.<br/>
![Cool down](/photo/92214.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
### <span style="background-color:LightGray">Comments and Questions</span>
„ÉªCan I put sugar and chicken broth together? Or is it enough to put either? -> OK!(3/31)<br/>
„ÉªIt was unexpectedly difficult to make a sterilized space in my kitchen. I tried to keep there clean as possible as I could by spraying alcohol, I did not know to what extent I should clean up.<br/>
„ÉªPutting the petri dishes in the fridge might help it harden faster. But I did not it because I was not sure the inside of refrigerator is clean.<br/>
„ÉªIf I have time, I would like to research where I can get the items for the other kind of mediums.<br/>

### Sampling outside
4/1(Fri), I took wild samples in my neighborhood.<br/>
The subject I took were bark, cherry blossom, soils, a manhole.<br/>

## Combucha
**3/24(Thu)**<br/>
### What is Combucha?
Combucha is known as healthy food. It is totally different from what we Japanese know as Kombucha (ÊòÜÂ∏ÉËå∂).[The Forbes' article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinatroitino/2017/02/01/kombucha-101-demystifying-the-past-present-and-future-of-the-fermented-tea-drink/?sh=617e668e4ae2) explains Combucha(kombucha) as below.<br/>
<br/>
*"[K]ombucha is a fermented and sweetened tea often made with black or green tea. It is largely classified as a functional beverage, meaning that it is a non-alcoholic drink that contains vitamins, amino acids or other nutrients associated with health benefits. The process of preparing kombucha can vary but generally involves a double fermentation process wherein a SCOBY (a pancake-shaped symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) is placed in a sweetened tea mixture and left to ferment at room temperature for 1-3 weeks, and then bottled for 1-2 weeks to contain released CO2 and encourage carbonation."*<br/>
<br/>
The interesting point is that Combucha is made of bacteria and yeast.<br/> Although instruction manual with the Combucha kit says that the taste is fruity, and the taste changes as fermentation proceeds, I can't imagine what it tastes like.<br/>
<br/>
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) is also detailed.
<br/>
As written above, it is a general to drink it with mixing it with blacktea, we tried to make several mixture of tea and Kombucha(ÊòÜÂ∏ÉËå∂) as our experiments. We made 10 bottles of Combucha in different ratio of tea and Kombucha.

Each of us took home Combucha filled in a container. I put it in a refrigerator. <br/>

Waiting for growing...<br/>
<br/>
3/29(Tue) It appeard that I made a mistake! Combucha need not to put into refrigerator, rather it is better to be warmer place for the fermentation.<br/>
