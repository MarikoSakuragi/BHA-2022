### The diversity of life<br/>
Aristotle, Carl Linnaeus, Ernst Haeckel… They made distinction of life in different way. It shows how difficult it is to categorize organisms.<br/>
<br/>
Complex cells, single cells<br/>
<br/>
<font color="Olive">Bacteria</font><br/>

・Found in soils and water<br/>
・Eats carbohydrates<br/>
<br/>
*Characteristics and uses*<br/>
・Violacein<br/>
・Antioxidant, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial effects<br/>
・Dye<br/>

<br/>
・Unclear how to categorize them<br/>
<br/>
・Single celled amoebas<br/>
・Complex “intelligent” behavior<br/>
　They have memory.<br/>
<br/>
・Movement<br/>
　You can see the move. <br/>
　Similarity with robot.<br/>
<br/>
### Survival of the Fittest
Survival of the Fittest(「適者生存」in Japanese)<br/>
<br/>
### Limits to Growth or Petridish Planet
・Competition for Resources: Food (nutrients), Energy, Space, Water.<br/>
・Evading Competition: Temperature, Chemicals, Radiation, Gravity<br/>
<br/>
### SCOBY
“Symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast”<br/>
Combination/collaboration of organisms.<br/>
<br/>
Yeast to produce alcohol from sugar<br/>
Bacteria to produce acid from alcohol<br/>
<br/>
Bacteria produce cellulose<br/>
<br/>
### Symbiosis
“Sym” = “Together”, “Bio” = “Living”<br/>
Cell is one of the example of symbiosis.<br/>
<br/>
### Central Paradigm: DNA-RNA-Protein-Trait
Any organisms have DNA（DNA=information sources）<br/>
DNA(Gene) -> RNA(Message) -> Protein<br/>
<br/>
### How to observe and write down

## 3. Making Mediums
### Standard Medium
**3/22(Tue) & 3/24(Thu)**<br/>
**Contents**<br/>
・Water 500ml<br/>
・Sugar 15g<br/>
・Agar 6g<br/>
・Vitamin (optional)<br/>
<br/>
**How to make**<br/>
1. Mix every contents<br/>
Make a mixture of agar and nutrients to glow organisms.<br/>
(1) Put a stirrer bar into a little bigger flask.<br/>
(2) Pour 500ml water into the flask.<br/>
(3) Mesure exactly sugar and agar powder. When measuring, you should put a weighing paper on a scale.Instead of weighing paper, it is also OK to measure by using cups of beakers on the scale.<br/>
(4)Mix (3) into the water.(It is easier to put the powders if you fold the weighing paper diagnally.)<br/>
(4) Turn on the magnetic stirrer to mix up the water and the others.<br/>
<br/>
2. Sterilization<br/>
滅菌する理由。・・・オートクレーブは、高温の蒸気で殺菌を行う機械。<br/>
(1) Autoclave<br/>
・水が入っているかをチェックする。<br/>
・オートクレーブテープ<br/>
・蓋を締め切ると暴発するので、少しゆるめておくこと<br/>
・スイッチを入れ、〇〇分。（注意事項）加圧自体が終わっても、圧力が下がり切るまでは開けない。<br/>
.<br/>
3. Pour Liquid Solution into Petridish<br/>
・オートクレーブから出したフラスコをクリーンベンチの中に入れる。
・容器からディッシュに１〜３mmほど溶液を注ぎ、入れ終わったら蓋を閉める（やけどに注意）
・（YCAMはヤカンでやっている！！）
・滅菌済みでないもの（容器）をクリーンベンチの中に入れるときは、クリーンベンチに入れる前にアルコールスプレーを吹きかけて殺菌する。
<br/>
**Sampling**<br/>
Rub wherever you like with a cotton swab or a bamboo skewer, then spread it on the surface of medium. The spreading should be done gently.
<br/>
We took samples from many place: nose, arm skins, plants, surface of masks, the outside air, etc. Next week We will observe whether bacteria has grow on these mediums. <br/>

<br/>
## Homemade Medium
**3/27(Sun)**<br/>
Place: My kitchen<br/>
### Contents
![DIY medium Contents](/photo/92198.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
　・Water 250ml<br/>
　・Agar 4g<br/>
　・Sugar 6g<br/>
　・Chicken Soup 2g<br/>
<br/>
I bought these items from supermarket and ドンキ・ホーテ (a discount chain store) near my house. Plus I bought a small alcohol spray in a 100-yen shop for sterilization.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make more special mediums, you should add other stuffs (yeast extract（酵母エキス）, for example).<br/>
![Alcohol Spray](/photo/92201.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
### Protocol
(1) Clean up kitchen at first(unless you keep it clean always). I tried to sterilize the kitchen counter by spraying alcohol. I also sprayed alcohol to a measuring cup, a pot, and a spoon.<br/>
![Kitchen counter](/photo/92202.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(2) Measure what is need. As I didn't have a scale, I used sugar and agar which packed in small portions, because it make it easily to measure how many grams.<br/>
<br/>
(3) Mix water, agar, sugar, and chicken soup in a pot.<br/>
![Mixing](/photo/92203.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(4) After the water comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and cook for 2 minutes with dissolving with spoon.<br/>
![Mixing2](/photo/92207.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(5) Pour it into plates.<br/>
![Pouring](/photo/92211.jpg)<br/>
![Pouring2](/photo/92212.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(6) Seal the plate's lid. Parafilm is generally used for it, but in this time I used a clingfilm（サランラップ）.<br/>
![Closing](/photo/92213.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
(7) Cool them down until the agar get hard. It will take 1 day(?) till agar become hard.<br/>
![Cool down](/photo/92214.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
### <span style="background-color:LightGray">Comments and Questions</span>
・Can I put sugar and chicken broth together? Or is it enough to put either?<br/>
・It was unexpectedly difficult to make a sterilized space in my kitchen. I tried to keep there clean as possible as I could by spraying alcohol, I did not know to what extent I should clean up.<br/>
・Putting the petri dishes in the fridge might help it harden faster. But I did not it because I was not sure the inside of refrigerator is clean.<br/>
・If I have time, I would like to research where I can get the items for the other kind of mediums.<br/>

## Combucha
**3/24(Thu)**<br/>
### What is Combucha?
Combucha is known as healthy food. It is totally different from what we Japanese know as Kombucha (昆布茶).[The Forbes' article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinatroitino/2017/02/01/kombucha-101-demystifying-the-past-present-and-future-of-the-fermented-tea-drink/?sh=617e668e4ae2) explains Combucha(kombucha) as below.<br/>
<br/>
*"[K]ombucha is a fermented and sweetened tea often made with black or green tea. It is largely classified as a functional beverage, meaning that it is a non-alcoholic drink that contains vitamins, amino acids or other nutrients associated with health benefits. The process of preparing kombucha can vary but generally involves a double fermentation process wherein a SCOBY (a pancake-shaped symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) is placed in a sweetened tea mixture and left to ferment at room temperature for 1-3 weeks, and then bottled for 1-2 weeks to contain released CO2 and encourage carbonation."*<br/>
<br/>
The interesting point is that Combucha is made of bacteria and yeast.<br/> Although instruction manual with the Combucha kit says that the taste is fruity, and the taste changes as fermentation proceeds, I can't imagine what it tastes like.<br/>
<br/>
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) is also detailed.
<br/>
As written above, it is a general to drink it with mixing it with blacktea, we tried to make several mixture of tea and Kombucha(昆布茶) as our experiments. We made 10 bottles of Combucha in different ratio of tea and Kombucha.

Each of us took home Combucha filled in a container. I put it in a refrigerator. <br/>
