# Week6: Life in Silico

## Comparison between Iwasaki-Lab (University lab) and BioLab(DIY-lab)
### Iwasaki Lab
・It was large!<br/>
・The space in the lab was comparted to several rooms(including huge incubator rooms).<br/>
・Bunch of experimental machines are surrounded in the lab: incubators, freezers, centrifuges, cleanbenches, and autoclaves. <br/>
・There are so many caution statements.<br/>
・There were notes on equipments, rooms, and white boards that was written about who uses/used and manages what stuff.<br/> 
<br/>
(Extra: Their student room was very new and well organized. I envy it...)<br/>
<br/>
**Questions**<br/>
・I was interested in how they use the several experimental machines differently: for what experiments, for what purpose.<br/>
・Does lab equipments or environments of labs vary from another labs? I guess it might be different by organisms which they deal with.<br/>
<br/>
### BioLab (DIY Lab)
