# Week6: Life in Silico
## 4/4（Mon) Iwasaki Lab Tour
TWIns, Waseda University<br/>
## Comparison between Two Laboratories
### Different points
### Iwasaki Lab
・It was large!<br/>
・The space in the lab was comparted to several rooms(including huge incubator rooms).<br/>
・Bunch of experimental machines are surrounded in the lab: incubators, freezers, centrifuges, cleanbenches, and autoclaves. <br/>
・機械（インキュベーター）の価格や体積
・There were many caution statements.<br/>
・There were notes on equipments, rooms, and white boards that was written about who uses/used and manages what stuff.<br/>
・Their research subjects that they use in the lab is only cyanobacteria.<br/>
・High magnification microscope (electronic microscope? I'm not sure this expression right).<br/>
・The samples taken decades ago were still stored. <br/>
・Water purification system.<br/>
・Clean bench with UV light and gas burner.<br/>
・Electrical plugs hanging from the ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
(Extra: Their student room was very new and well organized. I envy it...)<br/>
<br/>
**Questions**<br/>
・I was interested in how they use the several experimental machines differently: for what experiments, for what purpose?<br/>
・Does lab equipments or environments of labs vary from another labs? I guess it might be different by organisms which they deal with.<br/>
・Do everyone in Iwasaki lab grasp where and what are all the stuffs in the lab, despite of  that the lab has numberless stuffs?<br/>
<br/>
### BioLab (DIY Lab)
・It is small compared to Iwasaki lab.<br/>
・Basically, all lab machines in our lab are just one, except of the incubators.<br/>
・There are few caution statements, notes, and lists for preventing faults or managing lab stuffs.<br/>
・We focus on not one organism (such as cyanobacteria) but treat many types of organisms. <br/>
・Normal microscopes? (upright microscope and inverted microscope)<br/>
・Using distilled water in a box.<br/>
・Simple clean bench which doesn't have UV light and gas burner.<br/>
・Using extension cords.<br/>
<br/>
**Questions**<br/>
・What is the difference of and electronic microscope and opitical microscope?<br/>
<br/>
### Similarity
・Both are messy...<br/>
・Taking off shoes and wear slippers(or sandals) at the entrance of lab.<br/>
・Biosafety marks on the doors<br/>
<br/>
## 4/5（Tue) Sampling at a Park
Sigo-yama Park, Meguro-ku, tokyo<br/>
