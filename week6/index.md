# Week6: Life in Silico
## 4/4（Mon) Iwasaki Lab Tour
TWIns, Waseda University<br/>
（Abstract of Iwasaki lab. I will write later...)<br/>
## Comparison between Two Laboratories
### Different points
### Iwasaki Lab
- It was large above all!<br/>
- The space in the lab was comparted to several rooms(including huge incubator rooms).<br/>
- Bunch of experimental machines are surrounded in the lab: incubators, freezers, centrifuges, cleanbenches, and autoclaves. <br/>
- The lab equipments are highly efficient. I guess these are absolutely super expensive. <br/>
- There were many caution statements.<br/>
- There were notes on equipments, rooms, and white boards that was written about who uses/used and manages what stuff.<br/>
- Their research subjects that they use in the lab is only cyanobacteria.<br/>
- High magnification microscope (electronic microscope? I'm not sure this expression right).<br/>
- The samples taken decades ago were still stored. <br/>
- Water purification system.<br/>
- Clean bench with UV light and gas burner.<br/>
- Electrical plugs hanging from the ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
(Extra: Their student room was very new and well organized. I envy it...)<br/>
<br/>
#### <span style="background-color:LightGray">Questions</span>
・I was interested in how they use the several experimental machines differently: for what experiments, for what purpose?<br/>
・Does lab equipments or environments of labs vary from another labs? I guess it might be different by organisms which they deal with.<br/>
・Do everyone in Iwasaki lab grasp where and what are all the stuffs in the lab, despite of  that the lab has numberless stuffs?<br/>
・Hou mach is the maintenance fee of Iwasaki lab each year?<br/>

（This was the caution *Manga* on other lab's door. "Please order reagents and consumables as soon as possible!"）

<br/>
<br/>
### BioLab (DIY Lab)
- It is small compared to Iwasaki lab.<br/>
- Basically, all lab machines in our lab are just one, except of the incubators.<br/>
- There are few caution statements, notes, and lists for preventing faults or managing lab stuffs.<br/>
- We focus on not one organism (such as cyanobacteria) but treat many types of organisms. <br/>
- Normal microscopes? (upright microscope and inverted microscope)<br/>
- Using distilled water in a box.<br/>
- Simple clean bench which doesn't have UV light and gas burner.<br/>
- Using extension cords.<br/>
<br/>
#### <span style="background-color:LightGray">Questions</span>
- What is the difference of and electronic microscope and opitical microscope?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### Similarity
- Both are messy...<br/>
<br/>
Numerous petri dishes were piling up. Why didn't they threw them away...?<br/>
![IwasakiLab_1](/photo/IwasakiLab_93826.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
- The lab was a mess. But I don't dislike this chaos.<br/>
![IwasakiLab_2](/photo/IwasakiLab_93827.jpg)<br/>
<br/>
- Taking off shoes and wear slippers(or sandals) at the entrance of lab.<br/>
- Biosafety marks on the doors<br/>
